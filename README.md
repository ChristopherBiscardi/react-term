# React Term

A couple of days back, I got an email from Columbia (the university that I'm stated to join) that I had recieved a new email ID. Hosting my own webpage on a university's domain had been long been a dream of mine. So as I learnt about being alloted some space on the university's Unix server I got excited and put something interesting together in one evening!
