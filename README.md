# React Term

A couple of days back, I got an email from Columbia (the university that I'm stated to join) informing me that my new email ID and other student IT services were ready. Hosting my own webpage on a university's domain had long been a dream of mine, so as I learnt about being alloted some space on the university's Unix server I got excited wanted to put something interesting. Since I already a boring [about me](http://prakhar.me/about) I decided to do something different and built a simple terminal emulator  in React!
